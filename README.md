# PPA Britney

This is a combination of code from [Ubuntu's britney2](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-release/britney/+git/britney2-ubuntu) and [Bileto](https://git.launchpad.net/bileto/) which sets up a full Britney instance to be run with PPAs instead of the actual archive. This is currently being used by the [Lubuntu CI Team](https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-ci).
